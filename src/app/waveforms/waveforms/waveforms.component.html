    <p>
      SPUD is the IRIS DMC’s primary data product management system.
      Complementing the DMC’s SEED and assembled data archives, which contain
      time series recordings, the SPUD system primarily contains derivative data
      products of other types (images, movies, etc.) created either at the DMC
      or by members of the community.
